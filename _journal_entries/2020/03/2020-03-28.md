# March 28th, 2020 - Saturday


## Fiiish!
- First stream in a while, but network is currently totally overloaded
- Did a quick stab at macOS version of Fiiish! using catalyst, but stopped when running into provisioning profile problems
- Added tvOS target to Fiiish, but ran into problems because Xcode 11.3.1 doesn't support tvOS 13.4. Waiting for xcode update, which will take a while due to slow network.
