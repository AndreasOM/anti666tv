# January 8th, 2020 - Wednesday

Did Fiiish! & Rust Epsiode 0019 today.
- Moved the existing three tools (asset, atlas, packer) from experimental to final repository
- Did some major cleanup
- Broke the atlas tool somehow

Bought a new phone as hotpot with a SIM-card from a different provided, hoping to fix the network problems.
Not sure it helped.
