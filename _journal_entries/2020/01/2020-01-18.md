# January 18th, 2020 - Saturday


## Catchup

- Talked about the [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/).
- Explained a bit about [Revision](https://2020.revision-party.net/).
- Went far too deep into Food. The codebase, not actual food - if you ignore the pineapple.
- First mention of [ShaderCrusher](https://github.com/AndreasOM/shader-crusher).

## Plan

The first rough outline of how, and when to stream what:

Once per week have a little catchup session. (Scheduled. Saturday)
Twice a week Fiiish & Rust. (Scheduled. Tuesday & Thursday)
Next week it will be Monday & Wednesday.

Once per week Demoscene Stuff (SixtyFour, or Food). (Unscheduled, but annouced).
Today, after Dinner: SixtyFour

Random Games. (unscheduled, unannounced)
