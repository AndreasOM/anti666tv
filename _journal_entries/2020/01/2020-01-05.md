# January 5th, 2020 - Sunday

No streaming today.
It's Sunday, I am in Barcelona - my home, and that means I have a pint down the pub, and enjoy their excellent vegetarian Sunday roast.

Looking back at the last week?
Didn't look to bad actually.
Had some trouble with keeping the stream stable, but managed to make some good progress on
- [omt](https://github.com/AndreasOM/omt-experiments), the omni-mad-tools, in the experimental branch
	- added the copy command to the asset tool, which means we can fully replace the old "pack_atlas.sh" now. Well, if we use the hackpatched "build_atlas.sh".
	- added the first version of the atlas tool, and extended that over the course of the week. [Fiiish!](http://fiiish.omnimad.net/) atlases can now be fully build by this.
- SixtyFour
	- finally made the engine render to a texture, so we can put it nicely on the correct layer in the tool, and actually see the menu in front of it
- Stream Website
	- started adding [journal entries](journal.html), this being the first one
	- added a [stream archive](streams.html) page.
- Other
	- exported the first few streams to youtube. At least the first ones I still had on disk. Try to enjoy [Fiiish! Episode 0001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwzO031sQFQ).
